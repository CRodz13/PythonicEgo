        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-description">I was introduced to the computer programming world when I was 14 years old.
          I spent many showerless hours crafting the skill at a premature age attempting to master C+. 20 years later I have returned to enter the Python world and My determination is unparalleled
          and I am grinding everyday to get to my goal as an expert level Programmer/Developer. Stay tuned mother fuckers!</p>

        <h3>Better than Lebron James</h3>
        <p>Another skill I had at a very young age was Basketball. Like computer programming, if I would have applied myself instead of choosing the lazy route, There
          is a good chance I could have gone beyond high school ball. Instead I didn't even tryout because of my inability to overcome my self consciousness.
          Twenty years later I will go from Leflop James to Michael fucking Jordan of the Python world.</p>

        <h3>Best Dad Ever</h3>
        <p>On top of being proud of the changes I've made this year, I am also one of the best dad's in the world. I cannot understand for the life of me
          how my "father" just didn't try harder. My son is one of the greatest things to happen to me in my entire life and is a huge drive in my motivation.
          I know that the changes I've made as a person are and will continue to improve his quality of life.</p>
